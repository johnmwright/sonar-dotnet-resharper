Sonar .Net ReSharper Plugins
=========================

My plugin has been accepted for inclusion in the SonarQube Community Forge and I'm in the process of migrating everything over there, including adding public documentation to the SonarQube Wiki, etc.

It's new home in GitHub is now https://github.com/SonarCommunity/sonar-dotnet-resharper

The CI build is available here: https://sonarplugins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/dotnet-resharper/

IssueTracking (JIRA): https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SONARPLUGINS/component/16153

Wiki page (very much a work in progress for now): http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/.NET+ReSharper

========================

I've created a fork of the [SonarQube](http://www.sonarsource.com) .Net ecosystem plugins [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SonarCommunity/sonar-dotnet) with the purpose of adding a new plugin to support the [JetBrain's ReSharper command line code inspection tool](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/command-line.html). I have full intention of submitting this back to the main SonarQube dotnot plugin repository once it's stabilized, under [SONARDOTNT-348](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SONARDOTNT-348).

** If you are looking for the *official* SonarQube .Net ecosystem plugins, please go to that [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SonarCommunity/sonar-dotnet)**
